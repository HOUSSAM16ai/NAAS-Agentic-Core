## D-001 · LangGraph as Primary Chat Handler
**Decision**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` is the real handler. The orchestrator microservice is DORMANT in the default development environment.
**Reason**: GitHub Codespaces devcontainer (`.devcontainer/docker-compose.host.yml`) only spins up the `web` container; it does NOT start the microservices stack from `docker-compose.yml`. The orchestrator at `orchestrator:8006` always fails with ConnectError.
**Consequence**: All chat goes through the fallback chain → LangGraph `run_local_graph()`. This holds for both Codespaces and Replit-style single-process deployments.
**Rule**: NEVER assume the orchestrator microservice is reachable. LangGraph is the truth — unless you explicitly run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` to wake the full stack.

## D-002
`app/kernel.py` is the authoritative composition root.

## D-002 · MemorySaver for Conversation Persistence
**Decision**: LangGraph uses `MemorySaver(thread_id=conversation_id)` for per-conversation state.
**Reason**: Simple, in-process, no Redis/Postgres needed. Works in any single-process deployment (Codespaces devcontainer, Replit, bare uvicorn).
**Consequence**: Conversation memory is lost on process restart.
**Alternative considered**: `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` — too heavy for current setup.

## D-004
Cross-boundary communication is API-first only; direct DB coupling is forbidden.

## D-005
Architecture documentation must be code-evidenced and updated in the same PR.

## D-006 · Single Persistence Owner — Monolith Owns Message Writes
**Decision**: The Monolith (`app/api/routers/customer_chat.py` and `app/api/routers/admin.py`) is the sole owner of writes to `customer_messages` and `admin_messages`.
The Orchestrator microservice may only persist when the Monolith delegates explicitly via
`compatibility_facade=True` AND signals success back via `persisted: true` on the terminal
event. Absence of the `persisted` flag is treated as failure.
**Reason**: Dual-write (ISS-014) corrupts conversation history and inflates LLM context.
**Implementation** (this branch):
1. User message: always written by Monolith at WS entry (`save_message(USER)`).
2. Assistant message: Monolith reads `event.get("persisted") is True` on the trapped
   terminal event. If True → SKIP local write; if False/absent → fail-safe write with
   2 retries; on retry exhaustion → `[CRITICAL_DATA_LOSS]` log + terminal `error` frame.
3. The `persisted` flag is preserved through `_normalize_stream_event` in
   `OrchestratorClient` (lines 280–283) so the router can read it post-normalization.
4. None of the local fallback paths (file-intel / exercise-retrieval / LangGraph /
   general-chat) ever set `persisted: true` — they don't write to DB.
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED — see `claude/fix-persistence-consolidate-8X8LT`.

## D-009 · Single Terminal Frame per Turn — No Silent Failure
**Decision**: Every WS chat turn emits exactly one terminal frame (`assistant_final`
on success, `error` on failure). The helper `_emit_terminal_frames()` in both routers
is the only code that emits these frames. `persisted` is emitted ONLY after a
confirmed save.
**Reason**: ISS-016 (silent failures) and ISS-017 (terminal-event corruption by the
unified envelope normalizer) both manifested as UI hangs. The previous finally block
had paths where no terminal event was sent (no content + no error + no pending_terminal_event).
**Implementation**:
1. `app/api/routers/customer_chat.py:_emit_terminal_frames` and
   `app/api/routers/admin.py:_emit_terminal_frames` synthesize a frame when
   the upstream did not provide one.
2. `shared/chat_protocol/event_protocol.py:normalize_streaming_event` now passes
   `complete`, `persisted`, and `conversation_init` through unchanged when the
   unified envelope flag is on (previously they were mangled to `assistant_delta`).
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED — see `claude/fix-persistence-consolidate-8X8LT`.

## D-007 · thread_id Must Equal conversation_id — No Re-derivation
**Decision**: LangGraph `thread_id` (MemorySaver key) is always derived as
`str(conversation_id)` at the OrchestratorClient entry point and passed explicitly.
It is NEVER re-derived inside graph nodes or fallback handlers.
**Reason**: Re-derivation caused context identity fragmentation (ISS-019) where
fallback paths opened a fresh LangGraph thread for a continuing conversation.
**Status**: DECIDED — implementation pending (ISS-019 open)

## D-008 · Postgres Checkpointer as Opt-In (Not Default)
**Decision**: MemorySaver remains the default checkpointer (D-002). Postgres-backed
checkpointing (`langgraph-checkpoint-postgres`) is opt-in via
`LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINTER=postgres` env var.
**Reason**: MemorySaver is sufficient for development. The trade-off (state lost on
restart) is acceptable in Codespaces but documented explicitly as ISS-020.
**Consequence**: Production deployment MUST set `LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINTER=postgres`
to preserve conversation continuity across restarts.
**Status**: DECIDED — implementation pending (ISS-020 open)
