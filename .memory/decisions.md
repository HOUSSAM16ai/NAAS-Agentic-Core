## D-001 · LangGraph as Primary Chat Handler
**Decision**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` is the real handler. The orchestrator microservice is DORMANT in the default development environment.
**Reason**: GitHub Codespaces devcontainer (`.devcontainer/docker-compose.host.yml`) only spins up the `web` container; it does NOT start the microservices stack from `docker-compose.yml`. The orchestrator at `orchestrator:8006` always fails with ConnectError.
**Consequence**: All chat goes through the fallback chain → LangGraph `run_local_graph()`. This holds for both Codespaces and Replit-style single-process deployments.
**Rule**: NEVER assume the orchestrator microservice is reachable. LangGraph is the truth — unless you explicitly run `docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d` to wake the full stack.

## D-002
`app/kernel.py` is the authoritative composition root.

## D-002 · MemorySaver for Conversation Persistence
**Decision**: LangGraph uses `MemorySaver(thread_id=conversation_id)` for per-conversation state.
**Reason**: Simple, in-process, no Redis/Postgres needed. Works in any single-process deployment (Codespaces devcontainer, Replit, bare uvicorn).
**Consequence**: Conversation memory is lost on process restart.
**Alternative considered**: `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` — too heavy for current setup.

## D-004
Cross-boundary communication is API-first only; direct DB coupling is forbidden.

## D-005
Architecture documentation must be code-evidenced and updated in the same PR.
