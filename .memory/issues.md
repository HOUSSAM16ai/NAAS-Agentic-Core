## 🔴 Critical — Core Architectural Flaws (NEW — Session 2026-05-05)

### ISS-014 · Dual-Write — Both Monolith and Orchestrator Write to Same DB Tables
- **Status**: CONFIRMED — core architectural bug
- **Root cause**: In the production path, every message is written twice:
  once by the Monolith (`app/api/routers/customer_chat.py`) and once by the
  Orchestrator (`microservices/orchestrator-service/`), both targeting the same
  `conversation_id` in `customer_messages` / `admin_messages`.
- **Effect**: Inflated message log, duplicated history fed into next LLM turn,
  context pollution accumulates over the conversation lifetime.
- **Files**: `app/api/routers/customer_chat.py`, `app/services/chat/local_graph.py`,
  `microservices/orchestrator-service/` (persistence layer)
- **Fix strategy**: Designate a single authority (see ISS-015). Add a `write-guard`
  flag (`persisted: true`) so the second writer skips silently.

---

### ISS-015 · Non-Unified Save Authority — No Single Owner of Message Persistence
- **Status**: CONFIRMED — partially mitigated (write-guard added) but root not fixed
- **Root cause**: The system has no declared "single writer". Monolith and Orchestrator
  both believe they own persistence. The `persisted: true` flag is a band-aid; the
  architectural contract is missing.
- **Effect**: Any path change risks re-enabling dual-write or silently dropping writes
  depending on which side is modified.
- **Fix strategy**: Declare in an ADR that the Monolith (or the Orchestrator) is the
  sole persistence owner. Remove write logic from the other side entirely.

---

### ISS-016 · Unsafe Fallback Path — Silent Failures, JSON Pollution, Missing Terminal Events
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Root cause**: The `OrchestratorClient` fallback chain has three failure modes that
  are not fully guarded:
  1. Silent failure: message written locally but DB write error not surfaced to caller
  2. Raw JSON pollution: intermediate JSON fragments streamed as chat tokens
  3. Missing `terminal event`: WS connection left open / no `complete` signal in some paths
- **Effect**: User sees response, but it's not saved; OR user sees garbled JSON;
  OR UI hangs in loading state.
- **Files**: `app/services/chat/orchestrator_client.py`, fallback handlers
- **Fix strategy**: Wrap each fallback in explicit try/except with guaranteed terminal
  event emission; strip raw JSON before streaming.

---

### ISS-017 · Terminal Signal Corruption — `complete` Event Distorted During Normalization
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Root cause**: The event normalizer in the WebSocket message pipeline mutates or
  drops the `complete` / `stream_end` event type during normalization, so the UI
  never receives a clean end-of-stream signal.
- **Effect**: Frontend stays in "loading" state; no clean message boundary for
  subsequent turns.
- **Files**: `app/api/routers/customer_chat.py` (event normalization logic),
  `frontend/app/components/ChatInterface.jsx`
- **Fix strategy**: Add explicit pass-through for terminal event types before any
  content normalization runs.

---

### ISS-018 · Architectural Split-Brain — Hybrid Monolith/Microservice Competing on State
- **Status**: CONFIRMED — design-level issue
- **Root cause**: The system is neither a clean Monolith nor clean Microservices.
  It's an unfinished migration. Monolith and Orchestrator share state (same DB tables,
  same `conversation_id`) but have no explicit ownership boundary. Each new feature
  risks landing in the wrong side.
- **Effect**: Behavior changes per code path, not per business rule. Debugging requires
  tracing two separate execution trees.
- **Fix strategy**: Freeze the migration state. Document which tables/operations belong
  to Monolith vs Orchestrator. Enforce via architecture tests.

---

### ISS-019 · Context Identity Fragmentation — conversation_id / thread_id Misaligned
- **Status**: CONFIRMED / LIKELY
- **Root cause**: `conversation_id` (DB row) and `thread_id` (LangGraph MemorySaver key)
  are not always the same value. In fallback paths the thread_id may be derived
  differently, causing LangGraph to start a fresh memory thread for a continuing conversation.
- **Effect**: Conversation history is lost mid-session when the system switches between
  Orchestrator and LangGraph paths.
- **Files**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` (`run_local_graph` caller),
  `app/services/chat/orchestrator_client.py`
- **Fix strategy**: Always derive `thread_id = str(conversation_id)` at the entry point
  and pass it through explicitly; never re-derive it inside the graph.

---

### ISS-020 · Fragile Checkpointer — MemorySaver Volatile, Loses State on Restart
- **Status**: CONFIRMED
- **Root cause**: `MemorySaver` is in-process. Any uvicorn restart (crash, redeploy,
  Codespaces wake-up) clears all conversation checkpoints. The system has no
  Postgres-backed checkpointer active (D-002 chose MemorySaver intentionally,
  but the trade-off is undocumented as a risk).
- **Effect**: Every restart = all active users lose their conversation thread.
  Multi-turn tutor sessions break silently.
- **Files**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` (checkpointer init)
- **Fix strategy**: Add `langgraph-checkpoint-postgres` with `APP_DATABASE_URL` as
  opt-in via env var `LANGGRAPH_CHECKPOINTER=postgres`. Fall back to MemorySaver
  if not configured.

## 🔴 Critical

### ISS-001 · SECRET_KEY Ephemeral — All Users Logged Out on Restart
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Evidence**: INFERRED (not tested live — requires container/codespace restart)
- **Root cause**: `SECRET_KEY: str = Field(default_factory=lambda: secrets.token_hex(32))` in `app/core/settings/base.py`
- **Fix**: Add `SECRET_KEY` as a permanent Codespaces secret (forwarded via `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` → `remoteEnv.SECRET_KEY: ${localEnv:SECRET_KEY}`)

---

### ISS-002 · 162 GitHub Security Vulnerabilities (15 Critical)
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Evidence**: GitHub Dependabot alert shown on every `git push` to this branch
- **Message**: "GitHub found 181 vulnerabilities on HOUSSAM16AI/NAAS-Agentic-Core's default branch (15 critical, 100 high, 63 moderate, 3 low)"
- **Files**: `requirements-prod.txt`, `frontend/package.json`

---

### ISS-003 · `full_name` Returns `null` in Login Response ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at runtime 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**:
  ```json
  POST /api/security/register → { "full_name": "Runtime Tester" }  ← OK
  POST /api/security/login    → { "full_name": null }              ← BUG
  ```
- **Root cause**: Login fetches user from DB but does not populate `full_name` into JWT claims or response schema
- **Files**: `app/services/security/auth_persistence.py`, auth response schema

---

### ISS-004 · Hardcoded Admin Credentials in bootstrap.py
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Evidence**: INFERRED
- **Fix**: Validate at startup — refuse to boot in production if env vars missing

---

### ISS-013 · OpenRouter "Host not in allowlist" — Fixed in Code, Needs Env Var ✅ CODE FIXED
- **Status**: ENV-DEPENDENT — works in current Codespaces (with allowlist URL match)
- **Historical evidence** (legacy Replit server log):
  ```
  Model nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free failed: Status 403. Trying next...
  All models exhausted. Engaging Safety Net.
  ```
- **Codespaces status**: OPENROUTER_API_KEY works when site URL is whitelisted — nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free responds correctly
- **Root cause**: `HTTP 403: Host not in allowlist` — `HTTP-Referer` was hardcoded as `https://cogniforge.local` in `app/core/gateway/simple_client.py:57`, but OpenRouter's allowlist contained different URLs depending on the deployment.
- **Code fix (done)**: `simple_client.py` now reads `get_openrouter_site_url()` from `app/core/ai_config.py`, which reads `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL` env var (fallback: `https://cogniforge.local`).
- **To activate** in a new Codespace whose URL isn't whitelisted: set `OPENROUTER_SITE_URL=<your-codespaces-public-url>` as a Codespaces secret, OR go to openrouter.ai/settings/keys → remove host restriction (set `*`)

## 🟡 Medium — Structural / Quality Issues (NEW — Session 2026-05-05)

### ISS-021 · Zombie / Dormant Components — Dead Code Confusing Execution Topology
- **Status**: CONFIRMED / LIKELY DORMANT
- **Root cause**: Several components appear in the codebase but are not on any live
  execution path:
  - `Conversation Service` (microservices) — stub, never called
  - `supervisor.py` (standalone, not the LangGraph supervisor) — seemingly unused
  - Some graph factories / pipelines that may be dead code
- **Effect**: Developer confusion about what is "real". Maintenance burden on code
  that has no runtime effect. Risk of accidentally activating a zombie path.
- **Fix strategy**: Audit with `grep -r "import"` to find callers. Mark dead files
  with `# DORMANT — not on any live path` or delete after confirmation.

---

### ISS-022 · Educational / General Pipeline Split — Uneven AI Capability by Path
- **Status**: CONFIRMED — design issue
- **Root cause**: The LangGraph supervisor routes to `chat_node` differently based on
  intent (`educational` | `general` | `chat`). The nodes behind these intents may have
  different context windows, different prompts, or different retrieval strategies,
  making the system appear "less intelligent" for some question types.
- **Effect**: BAC exam questions may hit a weaker path than general questions, which
  is the opposite of the product's goal.
- **Files**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` (supervisor_node routing logic)
- **Fix strategy**: Audit the node capability matrix. Ensure `educational` path has
  access to at least the same LLM quality and context as `general`.

---

### ISS-023 · Streaming Token Delivery Inconsistent — Blocks Instead of Token-by-Token
- **Status**: RUNTIME-ONLY / LIKELY
- **Root cause**: LangGraph `ainvoke()` vs `astream()` usage. If the graph uses
  `ainvoke()`, the full response is buffered before emission. Even if the WS handler
  streams chunks, the source is not streaming — so the user sees a long pause then
  a full block.
- **Effect**: The "AI is thinking" UX impression. Breaks the real-time tutoring feel.
- **Files**: `app/services/chat/local_graph.py` (graph invocation method),
  `app/api/routers/customer_chat.py` (WS event emission)
- **Fix strategy**: Switch graph invocation to `astream_events()` and pipe each
  token as a `stream_token` WS event.

## 🟡 Medium

### ISS-005 · WebSocket Events Not Traced ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at runtime 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**: Live WS session generated events [conversation_init, assistant_error, error] but ZERO WS spans appeared in `/api/v1/observability/traces`
- **Effect**: Can see orchestrator + LangGraph spans but blind to WS-layer timing (auth, message parse, event dispatch)
- **Fix**: Extract `traceparent` from WS query params or first message payload, create root WS span

---

### ISS-006 · OpenAPI Contract Mismatch — 13 Missing Paths ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at startup 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**: Server prints on startup:
  ```
  ❌ مسارات العقد غير موجودة في التشغيل: ['/api/missions', '/api/observability/aiops', ...]
  ```
- **Root cause**: Contract file expects prefix `/api/observability/*` but actual routes are at `/api/v1/observability/*` (prefix mismatch)
- **Missing paths** (13):
  `/api/missions`, `/api/missions/{id}`, `/api/observability/aiops`, `/api/observability/alerts`,
  `/api/observability/analytics/{path}`, `/api/observability/gitops`, `/api/observability/health`,
  `/api/observability/metrics`, `/api/observability/performance`, `/api/v1/agents/langgraph/run`,
  `/api/v1/agents/plan`, `/api/v1/overmind/missions`, `/api/v1/overmind/missions/{id}`
- **Fix**: Update contract YAML to use `/api/v1/observability/*` prefix

---

### ISS-007 · Database Writes Not Instrumented in Tracing
- **Status**: OPEN
- **Evidence**: INFERRED — confirmed no DB spans in collected traces
- **Fix**: SQLAlchemy async event listeners on `before_cursor_execute` / `after_cursor_execute`

---

### ISS-008 · OTLP / Jaeger Export Not Activated ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at runtime 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**: Server log repeatedly:
  ```
  Failed to send telemetry: [Errno -2] Name or service not known
  ```
- **Root cause**: `TelemetryBridge` is trying to connect to an external telemetry host that doesn't resolve in this environment
- **Fix**: Gate telemetry export behind env var check: `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`

---

### ISS-009 · Dormant Microservices Pinged on Login/Register ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at runtime 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**:
  ```
  User Service unreachable for registration ([Errno -2] Name or service not known), using local fallback.
  User Service unreachable for login ([Errno -2] Name or service not known), using local fallback.
  ```
- **Effect**: Every auth request has extra DNS lookup latency before falling back to local DB
- **Fix**: Disable external service calls entirely in non-Docker environments

---

### ISS-012 · `/api/v1/observability/performance` Crashes — Pydantic Schema Mismatch ✅ CONFIRMED LIVE
- **Status**: OPEN — CONFIRMED at runtime 2026-05-04
- **Evidence**:
  ```
  pydantic_core.ValidationError: 3 validation errors for PerformanceSnapshotResponse
  cpu_usage: Field required [type=missing]
  memory_usage: Field required [type=missing]
  active_requests: Field required [type=missing]
  ```
- **Root cause**: `PerformanceSnapshotResponse` schema requires `cpu_usage`, `memory_usage`, `active_requests` but the underlying `TelemetryAnalyzer` returns a dict without these fields
- **File**: `app/api/routers/observability.py` + `app/api/schemas/observability.py`

---

## 🟢 Minor / Tracked

### ISS-010 · Prometheus Metrics Endpoint Not Exposed
- **Status**: OPEN — blocked by ISS-008
- **Note**: `GET /api/v1/observability/metrics` returns JSON golden signals (latency/traffic/errors/saturation), not Prometheus text format

### ISS-011 · Memory System PostToolUse Hook — Pending
- **Status**: OPEN — in progress
