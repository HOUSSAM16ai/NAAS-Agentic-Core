# Governance

This document outlines the governance principles ensuring the independence, transparency, and integrity of the NAAS-Agentic-Core project.

## Independence & Transparency

We are committed to independent, empirical research. Our findings are published based on the principles of open science, regardless of whether they are favorable or critical of any specific AI model or provider.

* **Open Methods:** All evaluation methodologies, prompt suites (sanitized), and scoring rubrics are open-sourced to allow for external scrutiny and reproduction.
* **Negative Results:** We explicitly commit to publishing failure modes and "negative results" to advance the field of AI safety.

## Stakeholder Sharing

To maximize impact while maintaining safety:
* **Public:** Methodologies, aggregate metrics, and generalized findings.
* **Restricted:** Specific vulnerability details are shared privately with model developers (via Responsible Disclosure) and trusted safety partners before public release.
* **Never Shared:** Raw data involving minors or PII.

## Conflicts of Interest

All core contributors and maintainers must disclose any financial or professional ties to AI model developers or commercial entities that could influence the research outcomes.

* Current Disclosures: None.
