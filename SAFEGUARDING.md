# Safeguarding Policy

This project strictly adheres to safety protocols for youth participation in AI research and evaluation. Our primary duty is to the safety and wellbeing of all participants.

## Consent & Assent

For all participants under 18:
* **Guardian Consent:** Written permission must be obtained from a legal guardian or parent.
* **Participant Assent:** The minor must also provide clear, understandable assent.
* **Right to Withdraw:** Participants may withdraw at any time without penalty or explanation.

## Supervision Model

* **Trained Mentors:** All data collection sessions are monitored by trained, safeguarding-vetted mentors.
* **Designated Safeguarding Lead (DSL):** A single point of contact responsible for overseeing safety incidents and escalations.

**Policy Statement:** **No unsupervised data collection from minors.** All AI interactions are supervised or conducted within a controlled environment.

## Escalation Matrix

In the event of a safety concern, the following escalation paths apply:

| Severity Level | Description | Immediate Actions | Escalation Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Low** | Minor distress or confusion; inappropriate language (non-harmful). | Mentor pauses session; clarifies intent; logs incident. | Report to DSL within 24 hours. |
| **Medium** | Persistent distress; disclosures of bullying or anxiety; ambiguous references to harm. | Mentor terminates session immediately; separates participant; logs detailed report. | Contact DSL immediately; notify guardian if appropriate. |
| **High** | Immediate risk of harm (self or others); disclosure of abuse; severe distress. | Mentor ensures immediate physical safety; contacts emergency services if imminent danger. | Contact DSL immediately; notify authorities/guardian as per local laws. |
