# Grant Alignment & Value Proposition

**Purpose:** Maps project objectives to budget, methods, and deliverables to demonstrate R&D value.
**Program:** OpenAI EMEA Youth & Wellbeing Grant.

## 1. Strategic Mapping Matrix
| Objective | Method | Deliverable (Output) | Stakeholder Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Reduce Safety Failures** | Agentic Verification Layer | Open-Source Safety Code | **Product Teams:** Reusable architecture for regional safety. |
| **Evidence Generation** | Deep Pilot (N=15-20) & Telemetry | Evidence Report on Code-Switching | **Policymakers:** Data on specific regional risks (Darija). |
| **Capacity Building** | Workshops (N=100+) | Safeguarding Playbooks | **NGOs/Educators:** Practical tools to adopt AI safely. |

## 2. Budget Alignment
The budget (€42,500) supports the production of **shareable outputs**:
* **R&D (Personnel):** Funds the engineering of the Open-Source Toolkit and the analysis for the Evidence Report.
* **Pilot (Operations):** Funds the *validation* mechanism (participants/mentors) to ensure the toolkit is battle-tested.
* **Infrastructure:** Funds the compute (LLM APIs) required for automated red-teaming and evaluation cycles.

## 3. What Success Looks Like
* **Measurable:** >90% interception of unsafe prompts in the pilot.
* **Feasible:** Delivered within 6-12 months using existing open-source stacks.
* **Shareable:** A GitHub repository containing the Test Suite, Metrics, and Playbooks, cited by at least 3 regional NGOs.
