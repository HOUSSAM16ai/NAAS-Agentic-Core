# Impact Measurement Plan

**Purpose:** To measure the project's effectiveness on safety (primary) and youth wellbeing (secondary).
**Scope:** Pilot cohort and workshop participants.

## 1. Reach & Beneficiaries
* **Deep Pilot:** 15–20 learners (High retention, longitudinal data).
* **Broader Engagement:** Up to 100–150 students (Workshops, Beta testing).
* **Educators/Mentors:** 5–10 facilitators (Training & observation).

## 2. Measurement Methods
### A. Technical Impact (Safety)
* **Telemetry Logs:** Automated counters for blocks, flags, and interventions.
* **Repository Analytics:** Clones, forks, and stars of the open-source toolkit (measure of *reusability*).
* **Reuse:** Number of documented Issues/PRs from the community.

### B. Wellbeing Indicators (Non-Clinical)
We use lightweight, validated scales appropriate for adolescents.
* **SWEMWBS (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale):** Administered Pre- and Post-pilot. Aggregated to track general trends in confidence.
* **Perceived Anxiety Check-in:** Single-question Likert scale: *"How confident do you feel about using AI for exam prep?"*

## 3. Ethics & Consent
* **Opt-In:** All wellbeing measurement is optional.
* **Aggregation:** Scores are never analyzed at the individual level, only as a cohort average.
* **Referral:** If a student self-discloses severe distress in comments, the Safeguarding Protocol (Escalation) is triggered. We do not diagnose.

## 4. Reviewer Checklist
* ✅ **Validated Scales:** Uses SWEMWBS (appropriate for 11+).
* ✅ **Privacy:** No PII in impact reports.
* ✅ **Ethics:** Clear opt-out mechanisms.
