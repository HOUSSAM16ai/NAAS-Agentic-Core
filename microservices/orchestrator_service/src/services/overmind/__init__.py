#
# ⚔ PURPOSE (القصد):
#   This file establishes the `overmind` package and serves as its primary public
#   interface. It exposes the key components and services from the sub-packages,
#   providing a clean, unified entry point for the rest of the application.
#
#   By importing from here (e.g., `from app.overmind import orchestrator`), other parts
#   of the system do not need to know the internal structure of the Overmind package,
#   making our architecture more modular and easier to refactor in the future.
#
# 🧬 EXPORTS (الصادرات):
#   - orchestrator: The main service for running missions.
#   - schemas: Core Pydantic schemas for tasks and plans.
